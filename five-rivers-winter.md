# Five Rivers Winter Tree Scavenger Hunt

## Location

**Five Rivers Nature Preserve** in Albany, NY - 56 Game Farm Rd, Delmar, NY 12054

## Timeframe

Late autumn through the winter, right up until the leaves start appearing. This hunt includes trees that are reasonably
identifiable even during the dormant season.

## Overview

The hints are meant to point out distinctive characteristics so that scavenger-hunters can spot candidate trees
from a distance. The hints are not necessarily enough to provide a positive identification of the tree, you should
consult some more thorough reference material for this.

## Scavenger Hunt

### Level 1

*   **Crab Apple Tree** (hint: look in the orchard)
*   **Norway Spruce** (hint: look for a cone-shaped evergreen tree with "drooping" branchlets that hang down from the parent branch)
*   **Oak** (hint: look for trees that still have large amounts of deeply-lobed orange, red, or brown leaves on them even through the winter)
*   **Weeping Willow** (hint: look for the distinctive long, slender, flexible yellow branchlets that give this tree it's "weeping" characteristic).
*   **Shagbark Hickory** (hint: look for trees with bark peeling in long vertical strips which gives this tree it's common name; also hickory nuts or hickory nut shells on the ground around it)
*   **Boxelder** (hint: a type of maple, look for smallish trees typically with multiple trunks that have copious hanging clusters of "whirlybirds" through out the winter)

### Level 2

*   **White Pine** (hint: look for a tall pine tree with a typically irregular shape and a generally "soft" appearance; long, slender, flexible needles in clusters of five).
*   **Red Pine** (hint: look for a pine tree with stiff needles that snap cleanly went bent, in clusters of two; often with motley-colored bark).
*   **Cedar** (hint: look for somewhat rounded roughly cone-shaped evergreen with very small scale-like needles and "fleshy" cones)
*   **Aspen** (hint: look for tall slender trees with gray-white bark often growing in clumps; not to be confused with white birch, which has a much brighter white bark and tend to be less straight and more frequently has multiple or split trunks)
*   **Cottonwood** (hint: look for very large trees with irregular shapes and "soft" branches that tend to droop and bend; bark is grayish brown and deeply fissured when old, reminiscent of dry-cracked dirt. Related to aspens, young bark may be smooth and gray-white).
*   **Black Willow** (hint: look for slender yellow branchlets often pointing upward or outward; often multiple crooked trunks; dark bark; similar appearance to related weeping willow, but without the characteristic long weeping branchlets)
*   **Hemlock** (hint: look for evergreen trees with short, flat, but distinct needles, and small roundish cones)
*   **Sumac** (hint: look for short slender trees, not heavily branched, with large distinctive clusters of fuzzy red seeds)
